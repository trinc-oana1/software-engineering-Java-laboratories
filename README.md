# Software Engineering Java laboratories
This repository contains my Java-based solutions for Software Engineering laboratories. Each folder includes hands-on implementations of core concepts such as object-oriented programming, multithreading, file handling, and design patterns. These labs helped me learn Java and practice designing systems using UML diagrams.
